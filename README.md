# Brazilian E-Commerce Analysis & Predictive Modeling 🇧🇷

## 🚀 Project Vision
This repository is a comprehensive data science journey through the Brazilian E-Commerce landscape. Starting with an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, the project aims to evolve into a full **Predictive Analytics** suite to solve real-world retail problems.

## 📍 Current Phase: Strategic EDA
Currently, the project delivers high-level Business Intelligence using the Olist dataset:
- **ABC Curve (Pareto):** Product categorization by revenue impact.
- **Logistics Insights:** Correlation between freight costs and lead times.
- **Time-Series:** Revenue evolution and seasonality identification.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap (Machine Learning)
The next steps for this repository include:
1. **Sales Forecasting:** Using ARIMA or Prophet to predict future revenue.
2. **Customer Churn Prediction:** Identifying at-risk customers based on purchase behavior.
3. **RFM Segmentation:** Clustering customers using K-Means for targeted marketing.
4. **Freight Optimization:** Predicting delivery delays using regression models.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Data:** Python, Pandas, NumPy.
- **Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib.
- **ML (Upcoming):** Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Statsmodels.
